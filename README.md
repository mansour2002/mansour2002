### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Mansour

## About Me

    I am currently dedicated to developing multimodal foundation models that integrate diverse clinical and imaging data (PET/CT/MRI) for advanced prostate cancer applications.
    My expertise spans working with various imaging modalities, including PET, CT, MRI, OCT, and OCTA, to address challenges in disease detection, prognosis, and treatment planning.
    I leverage a range of advanced architectures, from Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to modern foundation models, alongside traditional machine learning methodologies.
    My work also involves extensive use of OpenCV for robust image processing and classical computer vision techniques.
    I am deeply passionate about the real-world impact and applications of AI, constantly exploring new frontiers.
    Continuously deepening my skills, I am actively working with Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Mansour

I am a Machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and computer vision researcher/engineer.

    Iâ€™m currently working on the classification and segmentation of retinal images (Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA)) for disease detection, classification, and treatment analysis.
    I'm using deep learning models as well as traditional machine learning models.
    I'm employing OpenCV for image processing and traditional computer vision implementations.
    I'm interested in the real-world applications of AI.
    I'm deepening my understanding of Generative AI by studying how LLMs can empower NLP and computer vision tasks.

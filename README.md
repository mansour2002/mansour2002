### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Mansour
 
I am a Machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and computer vision researcher/engineer.

    Iâ€™m currently working on multimodal foundation models that combine clinical and imaging data (PET/CT/MRI) for prostate cancer applications.
    I work with PET, CT, MRI, OCT, and OCTA data for disease detection, prognosis, and treatment planning.
    I use advanced architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViTs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and foundation models, alongside traditional machine learning methods.
    I employ OpenCV for image processing and classical computer vision techniques.
    Iâ€™m passionate about the real-world applications of AI.
    Iâ€™m deepening my skills in AI by working with Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).

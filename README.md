### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Mansour

## About Me

I am currently dedicated to developing **multimodal foundation models** that integrate diverse clinical and imaging data (PET/CT/MRI) for advanced prostate cancer applications.  
My expertise spans working with various imaging modalities, including **PET, CT, MRI, OCT, and OCTA**, to address challenges in disease detection, prognosis, and treatment planning.  
I leverage advanced architectures such as **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, and modern foundation models, alongside traditional machine learning methods.  
My work involves extensive use of **OpenCV** for robust image processing and classical computer vision techniques.  
I am deeply passionate about the real-world impact and applications of AI, constantly exploring new frontiers.  
I am also actively working with **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, and **Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)** to deepen my expertise.

## Key Expertise

- **Languages:** Python, C++, MATLAB  
- **Domains:** Medical Imaging, Multimodal AI, Deep Learning, Computer Vision
